# abc/mayhem/build.sh — build Berkeley ABC (logic synthesis + verification; berkeley-abc/abc) as the
# fuzz target, plus a clean normal-flags ABC binary for the golden-output functional suite (mayhem/test.sh).
#
# Target (ported from the old integration, name kept: `demo`):
#   demo — FILE-INPUT (CLI). src/demo.c is ABC's own static-library demo: it runs ABC as a library on a
#          circuit file given as argv[1] — `read <file>`, `balance`, `print_stats`, a rewrite/refactor
#          synthesis script, then `cec` equivalence verification. The whole circuit reader (Io_Read
#          dispatches on the file's magic/extension: AIGER/BLIF/Verilog/PLA/BAF/…) plus the AIG synthesis
#          engine run on the input bytes, so the natural fuzz surface is `demo @@` on a circuit file —
#          no libFuzzer harness. The old Mayhemfile fuzzed exactly this (`/demo @@` with a .aig seed).
#          Built sanitized at /mayhem/demo.
#
# ABC builds via its own GNU Makefile. It honors CC/CXX and OPTFLAGS/CFLAGS/LIBS, so we inject
# $SANITIZER_FLAGS through OPTFLAGS to instrument the *whole library* (the fuzzed code), not just demo.c.
# We build with:
#   ABC_USE_NO_READLINE=1  — drop the libreadline dependency (demo is non-interactive: it never reads a
#                            prompt; this also means the image needs NO extra apt packages).
# NB: we KEEP pthreads (the old integration linked -lpthread too): ABC's `#ifndef ABC_USE_PTHREADS`
#     fallback path in src/opt/eslim/windowMan.tpp has an upstream syntax bug (missing `;`), so
#     ABC_USE_NO_PTHREADS=1 fails to compile. pthreads is provided by the base image's libc.
# `make libabc.a` produces the static lib (rule `lib$(PROG).a`); we then compile demo.c and link it.
#
# Build contract from the org base ENV: CC/CXX/SANITIZER_FLAGS/SRC. (No LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE / standalone —
# this target is a direct file-input reproducer, not a libFuzzer harness.)

# Relax THREE benign UBSan checks that ABC trips on essentially EVERY circuit — they would abort the
# fuzzer before it explores any real defect (PORTING.md "benign UB that floods under halting UBSan"):
#   * alignment               — ABC's own fixed-size memory manager (src/misc/extra/extraUtilMemory.c)
#                               hands out blocks and stores pointers at offsets that aren't 8-byte
#                               aligned; the synthesis engine hits this on the very first valid circuit
#                               (e.g. i10.aig past `read; balance`), so it floods before fuzzing begins.
#   * shift                   — ABC's hashing / bit-packing across the AIG and SAT layers does signed and
#                               oversized left-shifts (e.g. table hashing, truth-table manipulation) on
#                               nearly every node, well-defined in practice on this target.
#   * signed-integer-overflow — ABC's hash functions and id arithmetic intentionally wrap signed ints.
# Applied ONLY when UBSan is active (skipped for the empty-sanitizer off-switch, which stays a clean
# build). ASan and the REST of UBSan remain ON and HALTING, so real memory/UB defects in ABC's circuit
# reader and synthesis engine still crash the fuzzer. Smoke-tested: the i10.aig seed runs to exit 0.
